"""EnvelopeProcessor — injects mandatory envelope fields into every log entry.

The envelope contract (``observability.schema.ENVELOPE_FIELDS``) requires
every structured log entry to carry nine fields. Four of those —
``timestamp``, ``level``, ``logger``, ``event`` — are added by the
default structlog processors (``TimeStamper``, ``add_log_level``,
``add_logger_name``, and the call-site keyword respectively). The
remaining five — ``schema_version``, ``process_id``, ``host``,
``sovyx_version``, ``sequence_no`` — are injected here.

The processor also OPPORTUNISTICALLY copies four contextual ids
(``saga_id``, ``span_id``, ``event_id``, ``cause_id``) from
structlog's bound contextvars when present. These four are NOT in
:data:`ENVELOPE_FIELDS` because they're scope-dependent — only entries
emitted inside a saga/span carry them. ``merge_contextvars`` already
populates them earlier in the processor chain; reading them here is a
belt-and-suspenders guarantee that EnvelopeProcessor remains
self-contained even if chain ordering changes.

Each cached field is computed once at processor construction. The
hot-path emit overhead is four dict assignments + one
:func:`itertools.count` increment + one :func:`get_contextvars` lookup
per record (sub-microsecond), keeping the §23 performance budget
intact.

Aligned with docs-internal/plans/IMPL-OBSERVABILITY-001 §7 Task 1.3
and §8 Task 2.2.

    ``host`` (``platform.node()``), ``sovyx_version``
    (``importlib.metadata.version``), and a per-process monotonic
    ``sequence_no``. The four cached values are resolved once at
    construction; ``sequence_no`` is drawn from an
    :func:`itertools.count` iterator on every call.

    ``itertools.count.__next__`` is atomic under the CPython GIL: even
    with hundreds of threads emitting concurrently, no two records get
    the same sequence number, and no lock is needed. The counter
    starts at 0 and resets per process, so the dedup key is the
    ``(timestamp, process_id, sequence_no)`` tuple — process_id
    discriminates restarts.

    The processor never overwrites a value already present on the
    record — call-site code that explicitly sets ``host=...`` or
    ``sequence_no=...`` (e.g. in a forwarded entry from another node)
    is preserved. This is what makes the processor safe to apply to
    entries originating outside the local daemon.
