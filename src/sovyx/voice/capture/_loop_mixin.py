"""Audio thread + consume loop — :class:`LoopMixin`.

Extracted from ``voice/_capture_task.py`` per master mission Phase 1
/ T1.4 step 9b. Owns the five tightly-coupled methods that move
samples from the PortAudio callback thread into the
:class:`VoicePipeline`:

* :meth:`_audio_callback` — runs in the PortAudio thread; counts
  xruns, copies the block, and dispatches to the asyncio loop via
  ``loop.call_soon_threadsafe``. T1.30-wrapped in
  ``try/except BaseException`` so no raise can ever propagate out
  of the audio thread (would otherwise drop into PortAudio's
  ``CallbackAbort`` and stall the entire capture chain).
* :meth:`_enqueue` — runs on the asyncio loop; non-blocking
  enqueue with oldest-frame eviction on overflow.
* :meth:`_check_sustained_underrun_rate` — band-aid #9
  replacement; rolling-window xrun-fraction WARN with rate
  limiting.
* :meth:`_consume_loop` — main consumer task: pulls frames,
  normalises, feeds the pipeline, handles ``sd.PortAudioError``
  with exponential-backoff reconnect (band-aid #10 replacement).
* :meth:`_maybe_emit_heartbeat` — periodic RMS / frame-count log
  for operator confirmation that the pipeline is alive.

Contract — same hybrid-Option-C pattern as :class:`RestartMixin`
/ :class:`LifecycleMixin`. Host-class state attributes are
declared on the mixin for mypy strict but initialised in the
host's ``__init__``. Method-via-MRO references resolve through
the composed instance:

* ``self._ring_write`` lives on :class:`RingMixin`.
* ``self._close_stream`` /
  ``self._reopen_stream_after_device_error`` live on
  :class:`LifecycleMixin` / :class:`RestartMixin` respectively.

Test-patch path migration (CLAUDE.md anti-pattern #20): the
methods reference ``time.monotonic()`` via the module-level
``time`` import in this file, so test patches that previously
targeted ``sovyx.voice._capture_task.time.monotonic`` MUST
migrate to ``sovyx.voice.capture._loop_mixin.time.monotonic``.
13 such patch sites were migrated in the same commit.

        is not thread-safe and therefore cannot be touched here. Drops
        frames when the queue is saturated rather than blocking the

        T1.30 — the ENTIRE body is wrapped in ``try/except BaseException``
        so any raise (``MemoryError`` on ``indata.copy()``, ``TypeError``
        on a malformed status object, ``AttributeError`` on a transient
