"""Capture-side factory helpers — platform key + bypass strategy list.

Split from the legacy ``factory.py`` (CLAUDE.md anti-pattern #16
hygiene) — see ``MISSION-voice-godfile-splits-v0.24.1.md`` Part 3 / T03.

Owns the small platform-aware bucket selectors that pick which bypass
strategies the capture-integrity coordinator should try, plus the
:func:`_resolve_platform_key` normaliser the orchestrator uses to
gate platform-specific code.

Internal — accessed via ``sovyx.voice.factory._capture`` from the
package orchestrator. Not re-exported as public API.
